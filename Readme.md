# SIEM- Security Information and Event Management

- Goals of an organization: confidentiality, integrity and availability
- Attacks are detected by continues monitoring called **Information security continues monitoring- ISCM**

- This is a technology and is principally comprised of two main components.
1. **SIM**- Seurity information management - collecting logs in a central location
2. **SEM**- Security event management- analyzing logs for event monitoring, co-relation and rule creation etc

It is a single software system that help to automatethe processes of **aggregate, parse and normalize** logs

- When logs are loaded into SIEM software, they are automatically parsed and normalized, with all the field headers identified.


## Types of Logs

- Logs contain entties that represent sepecific events occurring on a network or device. **log aggregation** is when the logs are gathered together from multiple sources



1.  **Operating system logs** are created on devices such as `Linux and Windows` systems. 
     Example:` log2.txt` shows linux logs as there are references to `etc/shadow` and adding users etc. and `log4.txt` is a windows system log file

   > Things to watch for in operating logs
   - an unauthorized user attempts to view privileged data, such as a company payroll file.

     - Security permissions events: For example, a user attempts to give themselves permissions to view and edit a privileged file.
    
2. **Application logs** are created by devices such as `Apache and IIS` (Internet Information Services) servers or webserver logs. Example: `log5.txt` gives login/logout activity by a usename
      
```
DATE            IP              USER    ACTIVITY
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Login
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Add Items to Cart
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Checkout
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Search
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Logout
```



    > Things to watch for in application logs
      For example, a `brute force attempt` to log into an administrative account on a web application.
      
      - Fraud events: For example, a user on a financial application attempts to transfer a large sum of funds to a suspicious external account.
  
3. **Networking device logs** are created on devices such as `routers, switches, and DHCP/DNS servers`. (DHCP-dynamic host configuration protocol- ) 
    
    > Things to watch for networking device logs
    - Administrative events: For example, a network administrator accidentally opens a `port allowing unauthorized traffic` into a network.
    
    - Network security events: For example, a `DHCP starvation attack` occurs in which the DHCP server receives thousands of requests in a short period of time, `consuming all available IP addresses`.
    
4. **Security device logs** are created on devices such as `IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint devices, and honeypots`.  Example: `log1.txt`

    Security events that can be identified by these logs include:
      - Endpoint events: For example, a `user accidentally downloads malware` onto their laptop from a phishing email.

      - IDS signature events: For example, a packet with an `illegal TCP flag` combination is identified by an IDS. TCP flags, such as a SYN packet with the FIN bit set, are illegal and shouldnâ€™t be seen on any network

Logs vary in format: A few examples:

  - Log 1: `User TJones Successfully Authenticated to 10.182.12.35 from client 43.10.8.22` 

  - Log 2: `43.182.12.35 New Client Connection 84.10.8.22  on account: PSmith: Success`

  Not the source and destination ip. 

  As the formats are different for the logs. We can use **log parsing**: Converting a single string as shown above into fields of structured data, Once that is done the logs can be rearranged into a uniform structure called **log normalization**. We may also have to change the timing format to military vs standard 12hr format. Important to note the source and destination ips an the usernames

  - Log 1:  `User |TJones| Successfully Authenticated | to |10.182.12.35 |from client |43.10.8.22|`


- Log 2: `43.182.12.35|  New Client Connection |84.10.8.22|  on account:| PSmith| : Success`

- During aggregation and normalization the goal is to extract the following vital information from the logs:

   - Date: `[17/May/2015:10:05:12 +0000]`
   - IP: `83.149.9.216`
   - Protocol and Version: `HTTP/1.1`
   - Resource Requested: `/presentations/logstash `
   - User Agent: `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 19_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.23.34.77 Safari/537.36`
   - HTTP Response Code: `200`
   - File Size: `7697`

   ## Creating co-relation rules and alerts
   - Logs have an enormous number of events recorded. Individual events are less helpful, but the in aggregate they can be co-related into meaningful information. This is called **Login co-relation**

   - Based on expected co-relation of certain types of attacks we can define certain rules. It is often easier to pseudocode before getting deep into creating a rule that will create an alert based on detection of a pattern in the logs that is suspiscious

     Detect:
    - More than three "Login Failed" 
    - From the same user
    - From the same IP address
    - Within a five-minute period
 

- For the detection of events in web requests its useful to know the response code- typically 200 is what we are looking for as it means success
- Informational responses (100â€“199)
- Successful responses (200â€“299)
- Redirects (300â€“399)
- Client errors (400â€“499)
- Server errors (500â€“599)

1. Create an alert when: There was suspicious and unsuccessful web activity from Beijing.
    - The protocol is HTTP.
    - The HTTP response code is not 200.
    - The source IP is from Beijing.
   
2. Create an alert when: There were floods of web requests from a single source IP in a short period of time.
    - The protocol is HTTP.
    - The same source IP appears more than 50 times within 5 minutes.
    - This is an estimate and the true setting may be adjusted depending on past attacks.
   
3. Create an alert when: There were suspicious successful web requests to access JPG images from IPs outside of the United States.
    - The protocol is HTTP.
    - The response code is 200.
    - The resource contains .jpg in the file name.
    - The IP address is not from the United States.

   - What is the name of the SIEM product you selected?
   - What is the name of the SIEM vendor organization?
   - What are the features of this SIEM?
   - What are the primary advantages of this SIEM ?


   # S P L U N K

Splunk SIEM product is called  **Splunk Enterprise Security** or Splunk ES. Advanced monitoring solutions provide additional benifits such as machine learning, AI, automation and response
**Advanced Monitoring Solutions**
- User behavior analytics **(UBA)** - Detects abnormalities in user activity- trigers alert when a user deviates from typical behaviour

If a user usually only logs onto a server between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, UBA would create an alert if the user logged in on at 2 a.m. on a Saturday.

- User and entity behavior analytics **(UEBA)** - it is expanded UBA to include servers, routers. Creates baseline behaviour and then detects abnormalities

- Security orchestration, automation and response **(SOAR)** Responds to incidents by creating logs and implementing mitigation strategies

- SOAR uses playbooks that dictate respose for typical threats- These can decrease incidence reponse time

   > Splunk commands and queries

  ` source="fortinet_IPS_logs.csv" attack_name="Oracle.9i.TNS.OneByte.DoS"`

`source="fortinet+IPS_log.csv" host="cae59c510a8" sourcetype="csv"

  Add `| stats count as total` to the end of the search and run the search again.

Splunk can create location-specific reports with the `iplocation` and `geostats` commands. 

`sourcetype="stream:http" | iplocation src_ip`

`source="demo_httplogs.csv" | iplocation src_ip | geostats count`

Looking at every thing together

- The volume of successful logins on the website
- The volume of unsuccessful logins on the website
- A geographic map illustrating where the activity is coming from
- A pie chart displaying the specific pages of the website that are being accessed


- A radial gauge of successful logins.
- A pie chart of users logging in.
- A statistical chart of the data in the pie chart.

Splunk tool dashboard displays all the infomation together

`source="demo_winlogs.csv" signature="An account was successfully logged on" | stats count as total`

select save as dashboard pannel

`source="demo_winlogs.csv"| top limit=10 user`

- Then you can keep adding various components to the dashboard by selecting the "existing" dashboard. Note that the dashboards can also be edited

- For each of the pannels you can select the
