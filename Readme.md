# SIEM- Security Information and Event Management

- Goals of an organization: confidentiality, integrity and availability
- Attacks are detected by continues monitoring called **Information security continues monitoring- ISCM**

- This is a technology and is principally comprised of two main components.
1. **SIM**- Seurity information management - collecting logs in a central location
2. **SEM**- Security event management- analyzing logs for event monitoring, co-relation and rule creation etc

It is a single software system that help to automatethe processes of **aggregate, parse and normalize** logs

- When logs are loaded into SIEM software, they are automatically parsed and normalized, with all the field headers identified.


## Types of Logs

- Logs contain entties that represent sepecific events occurring on a network or device. **log aggregation** is when the logs are gathered together from multiple sources



1.  **Operating system logs** are created on devices such as `Linux and Windows` systems. 
     Example:` log2.txt` shows linux logs as there are references to `etc/shadow` and adding users etc. and `log4.txt` is a windows system log file

   > Things to watch for in operating logs
   - an unauthorized user attempts to view privileged data, such as a company payroll file.

     - Security permissions events: For example, a user attempts to give themselves permissions to view and edit a privileged file.
    
2. **Application logs** are created by devices such as `Apache and IIS` (Internet Information Services) servers or webserver logs. Example: `log5.txt` gives login/logout activity by a usename
      
```
DATE            IP              USER    ACTIVITY
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Login
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Add Items to Cart
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Checkout
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Search
01/13/19	42.34.65.34	billy	Logout
```



    > Things to watch for in application logs
      For example, a `brute force attempt` to log into an administrative account on a web application.
      
      - Fraud events: For example, a user on a financial application attempts to transfer a large sum of funds to a suspicious external account.
  
3. **Networking device logs** are created on devices such as `routers, switches, and DHCP/DNS servers`. (DHCP-dynamic host configuration protocol- ) 
    
    > Things to watch for networking device logs
    - Administrative events: For example, a network administrator accidentally opens a `port allowing unauthorized traffic` into a network.
    
    - Network security events: For example, a `DHCP starvation attack` occurs in which the DHCP server receives thousands of requests in a short period of time, `consuming all available IP addresses`.
    
4. **Security device logs** are created on devices such as `IDS/IPS, firewalls, endpoint devices, and honeypots`.  Example: `log1.txt`

    Security events that can be identified by these logs include:
      - Endpoint events: For example, a `user accidentally downloads malware` onto their laptop from a phishing email.

      - IDS signature events: For example, a packet with an `illegal TCP flag` combination is identified by an IDS. TCP flags, such as a SYN packet with the FIN bit set, are illegal and shouldnâ€™t be seen on any network

Logs vary in format: A few examples:

  - Log 1: `User TJones Successfully Authenticated to 10.182.12.35 from client 43.10.8.22` 

  - Log 2: `43.182.12.35 New Client Connection 84.10.8.22  on account: PSmith: Success`

  Not the source and destination ip. 

  As the formats are different for the logs. We can use **log parsing**: Converting a single string as shown above into fields of structured data, Once that is done the logs can be rearranged into a uniform structure called **log normalization**. We may also have to change the timing format to military vs standard 12hr format. Important to note the source and destination ips an the usernames

  - Log 1:  `User |TJones| Successfully Authenticated | to |10.182.12.35 |from client |43.10.8.22|`


- Log 2: `43.182.12.35|  New Client Connection |84.10.8.22|  on account:| PSmith| : Success`

- During aggregation and normalization the goal is to extract the following vital information from the logs:

   - Date: `[17/May/2015:10:05:12 +0000]`
   - IP: `83.149.9.216`
   - Protocol and Version: `HTTP/1.1`
   - Resource Requested: `/presentations/logstash `
   - User Agent: `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 19_9_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/32.23.34.77 Safari/537.36`
   - HTTP Response Code: `200`
   - File Size: `7697`

   ## Creating co-relation rules and alerts
   - Logs have an enormous number of events recorded. Individual events are less helpful, but the in aggregate they can be co-related into meaningful information. This is called **Login co-relation**

   - Based on expected co-relation of certain types of attacks we can define certain rules. It is often easier to pseudocode before getting deep into creating a rule that will create an alert based on detection of a pattern in the logs that is suspiscious

     Detect:
    - More than three "Login Failed" 
    - From the same user
    - From the same IP address
    - Within a five-minute period
 

- For the detection of events in web requests its useful to know the response code- typically 200 is what we are looking for as it means success
- Informational responses (100â€“199)
- Successful responses (200â€“299)
- Redirects (300â€“399)
- Client errors (400â€“499)
- Server errors (500â€“599)

1. Create an alert when: There was suspicious and unsuccessful web activity from Beijing.
    - The protocol is HTTP.
    - The HTTP response code is not 200.
    - The source IP is from Beijing.
   
2. Create an alert when: There were floods of web requests from a single source IP in a short period of time.
    - The protocol is HTTP.
    - The same source IP appears more than 50 times within 5 minutes.
    - This is an estimate and the true setting may be adjusted depending on past attacks.
   
3. Create an alert when: There were suspicious successful web requests to access JPG images from IPs outside of the United States.
    - The protocol is HTTP.
    - The response code is 200.
    - The resource contains .jpg in the file name.
    - The IP address is not from the United States.

   - What is the name of the SIEM product you selected?
   - What is the name of the SIEM vendor organization?
   - What are the features of this SIEM?
   - What are the primary advantages of this SIEM ?

- Organizations need to **aggregate**, **parse**, **normalize** and **corelate** logs and make sure the basic principals of confidentiality, integrity and availability are well guarded

   # S P L U N K 
   [splunkbase.splunk.com](https://splunkbase.splunk.com)

Splunk SIEM product is called  **Splunk Enterprise Security** or **Splunk ES**. Advanced monitoring solutions provide additional benifits such as machine learning, AI, automation and response
**Advanced Monitoring Solutions**
- User behavior analytics **(UBA)** - Detects abnormalities in user activity- trigers alert when a user deviates from typical behaviour

If a user usually only logs onto a server between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, UBA would create an alert if the user logged in on at 2 a.m. on a Saturday.

- User and entity behavior analytics **(UEBA)** - it is expanded UBA to include servers, routers. Creates baseline behaviour and then detects abnormalities

- Security orchestration, automation and response **(SOAR)** Responds to incidents by creating logs and implementing mitigation strategies



## Adding data to splunk

- Splunk architechture : The indexer, Search head
- When data is added to Splunk, it transforms the individual events to individual repositories called indexes
- The searh head allows queries to the search

- Options for uploading data: upload (manually), monitor, forward

- Once you upload a file Splunk will recognize the fieds and headers and then automates the parsing and normalizing of the logs
- `Host Field Value` is a name assigned by Splunk to the logs generatec by a machine



## Search Queries in Splunk

- One of the goals of the examinig the logs is to identif attacks and more specifically the user id and and the ip address of the attacker

- It is almost always time based and can be analyzed as relative (you specify time/date range), real-time (as its happening and updated momenterily) or all time (everythin that is available)

- Splunk has its own programming language - called SPL (Splunk Processing Language)

 **Key-Value Pairs**
- Key variable name and value is the actual value stored in the varibale e-g `user=josh` where user is the key and josh is the value

- if the search value has a space, comma, or pipe, it needs double quotes around the value `user="Jay Idrees"`
- Wild cards: 

For example, `user=mary*` would return:
- mary ann
- mary beth
- mary belle
- Wildcards can also be used to find a value surrounded by any character.

For example, `user=*beth*` would return:
- mary beth
- bethanny
- elizabeth

- Using **AND**, **OR**, **NOT**, If you do not specify then AND is automatically asumed

- `user=jonathan activity=login` is equivalent to `user="Jay Idrees" AND activity=login`

- `user=jonathan OR user=beth`

- `user=jonathan NOT activity=logout` , NOT is used to exclude certain criteria

- Once you upload a file and then run the search- specify the host name. The following fields will be automatically populated

**Default when you load the file**

`source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_server" sourcetype="csv"`

- To the default above, you can then add more queries. As you will be able to see to the left of the view there is a column that lists all the variables. For example if I want to look at what variable stores information about the IP address. In this file that variable is "src_ip". So If I want to search for a specific ip I can add:

- `source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_server" sourcetype="csv" src_ip="10.11.36.17"`

Each server and application creates their own key and value names.

  - For example, if we need to find users that logged into a machine, the key can vary depending on the server or application. It might be any of the following:
      - `Activity`
      - `Event_type`
      - `User_activity`

  - The value can also vary:
      - `Login`
      - `Logon`
      - `Logged In`


Fields are divided into **default fields** and **interesting fields**.

- Default fields are the fields that appear in every log event.

- Interesting fields are fields that appear in at least 20% of the log events.


**Adding additional commands to the queries**

- source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_Server_" sourcetype="csv" `src_ip="10.11.36.17"`

- Likewise it will also be useful to look at deletd user or locked out user accounts

- `source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_server" sourcetype="csv" name="A user account was locked out"`
- `source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_server" sourcetype="csv" name="A user account was deleted"`
- Likewise `attack_name="Oracle.9i.TNS.OneByte.DoS` could be another useful piece of information for the query

- You can become even more specific to query for a specific domain or a specific day

- `source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_server" sourcetype="csv" dest_nt_domain=Domain_B date_wday=tuesday`

**Piping the search queries**

- We can use piping with `head`, `tail` and `sort`

-  `source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_Server" sourcetype="csv" | head 20 | sort src_ip` Note the placement of sort after head. This command will first shortlist the top 20 data points, and when that is done, then it will sort or re-arrange those 20 based on the ip address

- `source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_Server" sourcetype="csv" | sort src_ip | head 20 ` Here the tables have turned. Now all the ips are sorted first and then only the top 10 are displayed after the sorting is complete

**Using Top and limit**

`source="Linux_login.csv" host="Linux_Server" sourcetype="csv" subject="An account was successfully logged in | top limit=10 user`
- The top command is valuable because it gives a simple count and percentage, the limit set how many different users are showed in the report - Like it will show the 

**Relatively complex query**
-   `source="winevent_logs_2.csv" name="A user account was locked out" Account_Name="user_d" | head 50 | sort ComputerName` 

- `source="server_speedtest.csv" host="upload_download_speed" sourcetype="csv" | eval ratio='UPLOAD_MEGABITS'/'DOWNLOAD_MEGABITS' | sort _time | table _time IP_ADDRESS UPLOAD_MEGABITS DOWNLOAD_MEGABITS ratio`

- `source="nessus_logs.csv" host="Nessus_Logs" sourcetype="csv" dest_ip="10.11.36.23" | stats count(eval(severity="critical")) AS "Critical Database Server Vulnerabilities"`


## The Next Level of Search Queries in Splunk
 - Using `stat` - Creates basic statistical report, `eval`, Determining a baseline, Desigining an alert and creating new variables

**Counting with Stat**

- I can use the basic stat command to obtain simple count of an event or as in this case simply counting the number of events by count
 - `source="statsreport.csv" | stats count by Account_Name`

      - `source="statsreport.csv`: The search being conducted, pulling the source of Windows event security logs.

      - `| stats count by Account_Name`: Pipes the search results, creates a statistical report of the `Account_Name` field and shows the number of events that each `Account_Name` appears in.


**Creating New Variable with Eval**

- Here I am creating a new variable named BruteForce and assigining two values 'Potential Brute Force' or 'Not brute Force'. Note that many type of events have code, for example here the event code 4740 represents a brute force attack

- `source="statsreport.csv"  | eval BruteForce = if('EventCode'="4740","Potential Brute Force", "Not Brute Force")`

  - `source="statsreport.csv"`: Searches through all the results from the `statsreport.csv` file.

  - `eval BruteForce`: Creates a new field called `BruteForce`.

  - `if('EventCode'="4740",`: States the expression, If the event code field has a value of 4740.

  - `"Potential Brute Force",`: Continues the statement with, If true, name this value `Potential Brute Force`. This is the value to display if the expression for the event is true.

  - `"Not Brute Force"`: Continues the statement with, If false, name this value `Not Brute Force`.

**Using `iplocation` and `geolocation`**

- `source="demo_httplogs.csv" | iplocation src_ip | geostats count` This is a very useful query. The iplocation command will grab individual ip addresses and determine which part of the world are they from. The geostats command then maps it on the world map




## Designing an Alert with Splunk

- Goal is to avoid `false positive`, `false negative` and `alert fatigue`

- **Search/Report results:** Indicate which criteria to check.
  - For example: 300 logins have been attempted.

- **Time parameters:** Indicate the time period to check.
  - For example: Within last 24 hours.

- **Schedule:** Determines the frequency by which these criteria are checked. 
  - For example: Every day at 12 p.m.

- **trigger action** when a condition is met and alert the Splunk user.
  - For example: Send an email to soc_manager@acme.com.

- Determining the **Baseline** and setting up the **Threshold**



## Things to monitor visually

> Obtaining a complete picture about the stat of an application

- The volume of successful logins on the website.
- The volume of unsuccessful logins on the website.
- A geographic map illustrating where the activity is coming from.
- A pie chart displaying the specific pages of the website that are being accessed.

- Successful logins: `source="demo_winlogs.csv" signature="An account was successfully logged on" | stats count as total` Once you get this send it to the dashboard pannel. For the first time you will have to select the 'new' option. For the subsequent times choose 'existing'. You can also use edit to rearrange






# Analyzing Example Logs and Creating Reports Exercise

1. Here I am using the windows server logs file, analyzing the `signature` variable which documents activity with a particular user account such as lock out or delition, along with a `signature_id` that contains specific codes assigned to such events

- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv" | table signature signature_id | dedup signature` The `dedup` command here removes the duplicates

2. Obtaining count and percent of the variable `severity` which reports the vulnerabilities

- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv" | top severity` This command will detail the count + % for each of the categories within the variable severity. Typical options are: Critical, high, medium, low, informational

3. Obtaining count and percent of the variable `status` which reports whether a login was successful or not

- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv" | top status`

- Note that for the above two command if I type `top status severity` together then it will be as if I typed  `top status AND severity` then it will generate data based on  combinations of the individual categories within each of the individual variables

4. Designing **alert** whenever a `status` is reported as `failure` of login

- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv" status=failure` This will genetate the count and then you can create an alert. In this case the average/hr from graphs appear to be around 6/hr so I can set the threshold to 15

5. Determining how often an account was successfully logged on using the `signature` variable. Then an alert can be configured based on average per hr and then a threshold is decide. In this case the avegrage appears to be 12 events and then the threshold can be 30

- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv" signature="An account was successfully logged on"`


6. Quering how often an account is deleted using the `signature` variable

- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv" signature_id="4726"`

<div class="text-blue mb-2">
Hello
</div>

<div class="text-blue mb-2">
  .text-blue on white
</div>

**7.** Creating a **`Timechart`** (very useful command) for the various types of activities captured in `signature`


- `source="windows_server_logs.csv" host="Windows_Server_Logs" sourcetype="csv"  | timechart span=1h count by signature` Here the command `timechart` will break the data (`signature` variable in this case) into segments
